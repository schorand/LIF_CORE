## How it works

This project implements a mixed precision leaky integarte and fire (LIF) neuron. It either computes one neuron at a time with 24bit membrane value and 8 bit weights or two neurons with 12bit membrane values and 4 bit weights.

## How to test

Apply the weight at the input and observe spikes. <- Will be updated later

## External hardware

none
